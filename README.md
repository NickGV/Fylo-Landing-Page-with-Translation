# Fylo Landing Page with Translation (English/Spanish) using React

This project is a landing page for Fylo built with React, featuring translation functionality between English and Spanish. It is based on a template originally created for a [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-dark-theme-landing-page-5ca5f2d21e82137ec91a50fd/hub) Challenge, which can be found [here](https://github.com/NickGV/frontend-challenges/tree/main/JUNIOR/fylo-dark-theme-landing-page). The template was repurposed and enhanced to include dynamic language translation and React components.
